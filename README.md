## 🎯 What is Project Marlin?

**Project Marlin** is a task where you prompt an AI model to generate **production-ready Pull Requests (PRs)** for open-source Python repositories. Your goal is to:

1. Select a complex PR from a repository
2. Prepare a detailed strategy and prompt
3. Guide an AI model through multiple turns to implement the PR
4. Ensure the final code is production-ready and mergeable

**Key Points:**
- ✅ You work with **two AI trajectories** (A and B) simultaneously
- ✅ Each task requires **at least 3 turns** to be complete
- ✅ You must **test and verify** all code changes
- ✅ Final submission must be **production-ready** (ready to merge)

---

```bash
# Navigate to repository root
cd ~/marlin/[repo-name]/[pr-number]/[extracted-directory]

# Copy claude-hfi from Downloads (adjust path for WSL)
cp /mnt/c/Users/TIWAR/Downloads/[downloaded-filename] ./claude-hfi

# Make it executable
chmod +x claude-hfi

# Verify
ls -la claude-hfi
```

**⚠️ Important**: Each repository needs its own copy of `claude-hfi` at the root!

##### **5. Launch claude-hfi**

```bash
# Launch in VS Code mode
./claude-hfi --vscode
```

**Output:**
```
Trajectory A:
  Worktree: ~/.cache/claude-hfi/.../A
  Terminal: tmux attach -t <session-id>-A

Trajectory B:
  Worktree: ~/.cache/claude-hfi/.../B
  Terminal: tmux attach -t <session-id>-B

HFI - Human Feedback Interface

**⚠️ Violation = Rejection + Possible Dismissal!**

---

#### **2. Minimum 3 Turns Required!**

**❌ DON'T:**
- Submit after 1 or 2 turns
- Choose PRs that are too simple

**✅ DO:**
- Ensure at least 3 turns
- Choose complex PRs
- Guide the model through iterations

**Why?** If the model completes the PR in 1 turn, the task was too simple!

---



**✅ DO:**

- Verify all functionality works

---

#### **4. Python Code Required!**

**❌ DON'T:**
- Select PRs with no Python changes
- Select documentation-only PRs
- Select config-only PRs

**✅ DO:**
- Choose PRs with significant Python code changes
- Check the diff on GitHub
- Verify Python files are modified

---

#### **5. Use Correct PR Link!**

**❌ WRONG:**
```
https://github.com/user/repo/tree/branch-name
```

**✅ CORRECT:**
```
https://github.com/user/repo/pull/123
```

Must link to the **pull request**, not the repository or branch!

---

### **📌 Important Notes:**

1. **Reviews**: Happen during night (US time), check email in the morning , Speed is improving it can be after few hrs also check emails

---

**Remember**: Quality over quantity. Take your time, be thorough, and use your own expertise!
